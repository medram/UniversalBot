## UniversalBot
Hi there!
UniversalBot is a platform for automating warm up of most ISPs.

## Features:
UniversalBot supports the folowing features:
- loading accounts from a csv file.
- managing accounts, proxies, servers, actions, workers and tasks very easily.
- 5 actions of Hotmail and 1 Gmail actions (more actions are coming soon).
- UniversalBot uses existing Firefox profiles, or opens/creates one automatically.
- scheduling tasks.
- supports adding more ISPs actions very easily.
- UniversalBot is extendable and flexible.
- Distributing tasks on server in an efficient manner.

## Cons:
- ISP actions need updates from time to another (actions expires frequently).

## Next Features:
I will add these features in the future:
- Addling more ISPs actions.
- managing/ordering ISPs actions at performing them.

Any ideas or suggestions, I'm all ears.
